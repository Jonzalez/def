## **Introduction** 

Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) have been isolated and characterized from a wide range of animal, plant and bacterial species and are known to play important roles in the host defence system and innate immunity [@doi:10.1038/srep27394]

(AMP) are polypeptides of fewer than 100 amino acids contain a positive net charge (from +2 to +9), high lysine and arginine content, and a significant number of hydrophobic residues (â‰¥30%) [@doi:10.1038/nri1180]. These properties permit the peptides to fold into amphipathic conformations upon contact with cell membranes, and the positively charged polar face help the molecules bind to the membrane through electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged head groups of phospholipids [@doi:10.1002/(SICI)1097-0282(1998)47:6<415::AID-BIP2>3.0.CO;2-D*].
